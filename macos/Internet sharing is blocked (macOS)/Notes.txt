Notes: The provided profile gets the policy to pass, but I don't think the forceInternetSharingOff key is supported in macOS Sequoia. When I deployed the profile to test system that had Internet Sharing enabled, the setting remained on.

The closest supported key I've found is allowInternetSharingModification in the com.apple.applicationaccess domain. This will prevent a user from enabling Internet Sharing if it's turned off when the profile is delivered, but will prevent a user from disabling it if it's turned on when the profile is delivered. Kind of weird.
